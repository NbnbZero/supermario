Comments on Quality:
	- "Width" is misspelled in "BrickBlockWtidth"
	- Capitalization for variables is inconsistent (usually, its camelCase or private variables start with _)
	- In Update() you could probably use BlockSpriteFactory.Instance.BrickBlockAnimeTotalFrame so you have SPOC
	- Line 49 is pretty messy. Personally, I'm more of a fan of declaring a variable that is the value of the
		expression you're passing in, but thats a style thing and other people would disagree with me.
	- I dig the use of variables for certain things you access in MarioSpriteFactory, my only suggestion is to make
		them constants with const.

Hypothetical Change:
	- Make the variable names consistently camelCase
	- Use constants for things you will never change in the file.
