Comments:
	- First of all, easier for the reader to catch the functionality of the class which implement IAnimationInGame
        interface
    - uses char "o" to simulate the bubble
    - When I step in, I found the method is associates with MarioInfo.cs where stores all the timer and score information.
        From my perspective, it should be in MarioObject.cs where has all the mario attributes.
    - In the GameObjectManager.cs, the logic for the animation could be refactored to mario.Update() which makes the code more reasonable

Hypothetical changes:
	- Refactor bubble animation update to mario update
    - Probably could create bubble sprite to have a more real visual effect
